  ## Description
  With this application I wanted to be able to create a team profile by answering some prompts based off of what I wanted included in the profile. I wanted to be able to add multiple team members which consisted of engineers and interns. I wanted to be able to display the basic information that is given ang be able to access their emails and GitHub profiles. 

  ## Installation
  Node js is required to run the application in the terminal.

  Run a node index.js command in the terminal. Follow the prompts and fill in the information required. Once all information is filled out an html file will be created. open the html file in your default browser and see your teams info displayed!
